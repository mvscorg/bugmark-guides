# BugMark

## About

Blockchain Marketplace for Software Vulnerabilities and Issues

## Code and Documentation Repositories

We have three repos at the moment:

* End-User documentation: [docs][docs]
* Oracles and Web2 Management app: [web2][web2]
* Solidity contracts and Dapp(s): [web3][web3]

## Status of the project and these docs

These docs reflect the pre-implementation V0 version of the project.  Rest assured we will return to these to refresh them once we reach our next milestone.

## Slide decks, presentations, demos, etc.

We have a slide deck that provides a slightly longer intro: [BugMark Intro Slides][deck] 

## Inspiration

Don Marti wrote a pretty [good summary][don] of some of the ideas we are looking to explore, here.
